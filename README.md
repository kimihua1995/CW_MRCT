# Inference of treatment effect and its regional modifiers using the restricted mean survival time in multi-regional clinical trials
This project contains the R codes for simulation study in the paper

source_estimator.R
```
Source codes including functions for generating weighted estimator of region-specific average RMST difference.
```

source_simulation.R
```
Souce codes including functions for data generation, application for functions in 'source_estimator.R', calculating the true value of the estimands, evaluation for the results, calculating standardized mean difference.
```

simulation.R
```
Codes for simulation and creating the plots.
